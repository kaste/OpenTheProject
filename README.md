# Hi

The plugin automatically opens a folder as a project.

:confused:? So, you usually type 

```
subl <folder>
OR
subl .
```

But this opens the folder not bound to any project data or project settings. :cry:  

We can fix that. :wink: If there is a `*.sublime-project` in that folder, we just open the project instead! And if there is no project file, we will ask you to create a basic one.
